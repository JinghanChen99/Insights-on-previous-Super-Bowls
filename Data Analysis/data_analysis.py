def general_info(data):
	"""
		This functions provides general information about the history of Super Bowls. It answers three basic
		questions: 
		1. What are the top five stadiums that hosted the most number of Super Bowls? And what was the average 
		point difference for these top five stadiums?
		2. Who are the top 5 QBs that have won the most super bowls? And what was the average point 
		difference for their wins?
		3. Who did the most Super Bowl winning QB played against? Who is the MVP in those Super Bowls? 
		And where did he won those Super Bowls?
		All of the data for this specific analysis comes from the SuperBowl_base_update.csv
		Parameters:
		data (file): a csv file that contains the dataset for this analysis

		Returns:
		a tuple contains three dataframes corresponding to the three questions
